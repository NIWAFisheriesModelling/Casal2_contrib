# Casal2_contrib
R package that extends the functionality of the [Casal2](https://github.com/NIWAFisheriesModelling/CASAL2) R package


## Installation
```r
devtools::install_github("NIWAFisheriesModelling/Casal2_contrib")
```
An issue you might find when installing this, is it has dependencies with R packages that are not on CRAN i.e. `library(Casal2)`. The package should be part of the installation or zip package that you revieved with your Casal2 executable, which can be downloaded from here. [here](https://casal2.github.io/casal/).

## Query Functionality
Once the library is installed you can query the functionality `library(help="stockassessmenthelper")` also see the vignette with the command `browseVignettes("stockassessmenthelper")`


## Collaborations
This repository is a resource for Casal2 users to share graphics and tabulation code for summarising Casal2 model outputs. To add function to this, please see *ADD document somewhere.*
